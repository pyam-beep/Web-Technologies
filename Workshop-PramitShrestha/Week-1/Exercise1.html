        <h2> <i>The IBM founder Mr. Thomas J. Watson Sr.</i></h2>
            <p>
                    Thomas J. Watson Sr. was one of the most successful and famous
                entrepreneurs in the first half of the 20th century.<br> With a 
                management style that was unique at the time, he made IBM the 
                leading supplier of punched card systems in the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                Before becoming President of IBM, Thomas J. Watson Jr.'s 
                determination did not equal his father's. His performance at 
                school <br> was poor, and he was only interested in flying.

                World War II, in which he served as a pilot in the U.S. 
                Air Force, changed <br>his life. He became resolute in his aim 
                to succeed his father at IBM and to prepare the company for 
                the computer age that was <br> just beginning. He asserted himself 
                against his father, and promoted the development of electronic
                punched card technology <br> and data processing.

                Whereas Watson Sr. stands for IBM's success as a punched 
                card company, Watson Jr. stands for <br> its success in computer 
                technology.
