                The Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660 Ti for laptops is a mobile graphics card 
                that is based on the Turing architecture (TU116 chip). Compared to
                the faster RTX 2000 GPUs (e.g. RTX 2060), the 1660Ti integrates no 
                Raytracing or Tensor cores. The performance is similar to the old GTX 
                1070 (laptop) but at a reduced TGP of 80 Watt (versus 115 Watt). 
                Compared to the desktop GTX 1660 Ti, the clock speeds are reduced 
                (3% lower base, 10% lower boost).
